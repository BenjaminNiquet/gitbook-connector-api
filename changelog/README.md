# Changelog

## 11th February 2022 11:20 UTC

* Re-structured entire API documentation to split operations by domain entities (e.g. countries, outletbills, products) rather than 'themes'
* API operations can still be viewed by theme on the new [Operations](../operations/README.md) home page, which now also provides a summary of each operation
* Changelog split by year to reduce page length, and [Deprecations](../deprecations/README.md) separated into its own page
* Link to Swagger/OpenAPI definition added to [home page](../README.md)
* Re-wording of [Point of Sale](../use-cases/point-of-sale.md) use case to improve clarity
