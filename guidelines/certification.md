# Certification

## How to start developing

While you're free to experiment with our API using the [demo environment](environments.md#demo-environments) credentials, once you get serious about writing integration towards Mews you should contact our integrations team so they can provide you with guidance.

## Development sandbox

Using shared demo credentials you may find yourself being stopped by [Request limitations](requests.md#request-limits) without you being responsible for triggering them. To prevent this you can ask our integration team for private set of tokens so your development will no longer be affected by other developers.

## Testing your integration

Once your integration is completed, all operations must be tested prior to initiating the [certification process](https://intercom.help/mews-systems/en/articles/4497819-connector-api-certification-what-to-expect). Testing your solution is done directly in the Connector API demo. More details will be shared with you by our integrations team.
