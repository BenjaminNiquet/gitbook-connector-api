## Event management

An event management integration can pull live information about rates and availability, create availability blocks (also known as room blocks or group blocks), affect property inventory, push contracted revenue to the relevant guestâ€™s profile in Mews, and allow users to manage the group reservations (already pushed into Mews) from the event management software. The sections below contain guidelines regarding the relevant endpoints used.

### Enterprise information

To automate the onboarding of a new property as much as possible, use any combination of the [Configuration](../operations/configuration.md) operation or [Enterprise](../operations/enterprises.md) to pull information about a property, including but not limited to resources configuration, applicable tax rates, services and products, company profiles.

### Rates and availability

Use [Get all rates](../operations/services.md#get-all-rates) and  [Get rate pricing](../operations/services.md#get-all-rates) to pull data about rates offered in the enterprise. Use [Get service availability](../operations/services.md#get-service-availability) to pull category availability and related adjustments from Mews into the event management integration.

*Note that the `Availabilities` array refers to the inventory that is available to the general public, and therefore does not include inventory that has been reserved for the availability block. The array of adjustments displayed are those not associated with an availability block.*

### Managing billing

In Mews, billing is managed at the customer profile level, instead of being charged to a specific room or reservation. If applicable, create a new company via [Add company](../operations/enterprises.md#add-company) or find an existing company via [Get all companies](../operations/enterprises.md#get-all-companies) and attach the company to both the reservation(s) and the customer bill(s) for more accurate billing and reporting.

Use a Paymaster customer profile to centrally manage the related order charges and billing. If the relevant customer profile does not already exist in Mews, first call [Add customer](../operations/customers.md#add-customer) to create a [Paymaster](../operations/customers.md#customer-classification) account. Should any information change in the future, you can use the [Update customer](../operations/customers.md#update-customer) to update the account details. Should you need to retrieve a list of all customer profiles created within a certain interval, use the [Get all customers](../operations/customers.md#get-all-customers) operation.

#### Adding revenue and payment items

One of the expected functionalities of an event management integration is being able to push items to the correct customer profile in Mews. This can be done using the operation [Add order](../operations/services.md#add-order). If the product item that is being posted already exists in Mews, use [Product order parameters](../operations/services.md#product-order-parameters). If the product does not exist in Mews then use the [Item parameters](../operations/services.md#item-parameters) to post custom items. 

Note that in order to use [Product order parameters](../operations/services.md#product-order-parameters), the property must first set up products under an [Orderable](../operations/services.ms#service-type) service. Then, you will need to retrieve the products by calling [Get all products](../operations/services.md#get-all-products).

To ensure correct reporting, all revenue items posted into Mews using Item parameters must be associated with their correct accounting category by sending the unique identifier of the accounting category in the request. Information about all the categories configured at each property can be retrieved using [Get all accounting categories](../operations/finance.md#get-all-accounting-categories). 

In case payment was taken outside of Mews or directly on the event management platform, use any of the methods described in the [Finance](../operations/finance.md) section to record the payment items in Mews, so that all accounting items are centralised in Mews for further reporting and/or exporting to the property's accounting system. 

#### Further automation possibilities

Call [Get customer open itmes](../operations/customers.md#get-customers-open-items) to review the revenue and payment items that have already been posted to a customer profile. You can then further automate the management of billing/invoicing by creating a specific bill via [Add bill](../operations/finance.md#add-bill) for a certain groups of revenue and payment items. Use [Update accounting items](../operations/finance.md#update-accounting-items) to redirect said items to the relevant bill and then use [Close bill](../operations/finance.md#close-bill) to finalise the financial document. 


### Managing group reservations with availability blocks

Availability blocks are used for reserving a certain portion of category availability in Mews for a specific group of reservations, as well as the subsequent management of reservations that are created in Mews for such groups. 

#### Creating availability blocks

First call [Add availability blocks](../operations/services.md#add-availability-blocks) to add a new block object with the relevant parameters. Note the `AvailabilityBlockId`, which is used as the unique identifier throughout Mews. 

#### Allocating inventory (capacity?) to the availability block

Now that you have created an availability block object, you can allocate capacity for different dates and resource categories (i.e. create room night blocks). Call [Update service availability](../operations/services.md#update-service-availability) to push availability adjustments into Mews. Send a *negative* value for the `UnitCountAdjustment` parameter and include the aforementioned `AvailabilityBlockId` in the [availability update](../operations/services.md#availability-update) parameter to reserve units of availability for the availability block you have just created. 

- *Example: If you wish to reserve 10 units of availability for certain date(s), send -10 in the `UnitCountAdjustment` parameter.*

Should you need to increase or decrease the inventory for your availability block, send the new total to override existing adjustments. 

- *Example: Original adjustment was -5 to reserve 5 units of availability for 1st of May. User now wishes to increase inventory for the availability block for that date by 2 (to 7 total). In this case, send adjustment -7 to override the original adjustment.*

It is possible to allow overbooking by allocating more inventory (e.g. adjustment of -10) than there are number of resources physically available (e.g. 9 units) at the property.


#### Adding reservations to an availability block

When a new reservation is created within the event management software, it needs to be synced with Mews, and vice versa. Reservations can be pushed into Mews using the [Add reservations](../operations/reservations.md#add-reservations) operation. To ensure that the reservations consume availability reserved for the availability block, instead of from the property's overall availability, include `AvailabilityBlockId` in the [reservations parameters](../operations/reservations..#reservation-parameters) when you [add reservations](../operations/reservations.md#add-reservations) into an existing group block.

It is also possible to place an existing reservation in Mews into an availability block with the [Update reservations](../operations/reservations.md#update-reservations) operation by including `AvailabilityBlockId` in the [reservations parameters](../operations/reservations..#reservation-parameters).

If applicable, you can attach a company to a reservation when calling [Add reservations](./operations/reservations.md#add-reservations) or [Update reservations](../operations/reservations.md#update-reservations).

**Note:** 
It is currently not possible to exceed the availability block capacity (the inventory allocated to an availability block through the [Update service availability](../operations/services.md#update-service-availability) operation. However, it is possible to add reservations with arrival or departure date times that extend beyond the [interval in a given availability block](../operations/services.md#availability-block-parameters). Should there be a need to accommodate more reservations in an availability block, you must first update the adjustments to increase the allocated inventory in that block.

#### Managing reservations and customers

To ensure that the property can further manage individual companions to the group reservation via the integration, use the [Add reservation companion](../operations/reservations.md#add-reservation-companion) or [Delete reservation companion](../operations/reservations.md#delete-reservation-companion) to assign guests to rooms.


#### Managing availability block inventory and pickup

Call [Get availability blocks](../operations/services.md#add-availability-blocks) to retrieve information about existing availability blocks, as well as all associated reservations and availability adjustments. To avoid the need of regular polling, you can make use of [Webhooks for Reservation events](../webhooks.md#general-message) to automatically receive information of reservation creation and/or changes. Note the `AvailabilityBlockId` in the [`ServiceOrders`](../webhooks.md#entities) object to record pickup for the relevant availability block in your system and in Mews.

**Note:**

It is possible to remove the availability block from Mews by calling [Delete availability blocks](../operations/services.md#delete-availability-blocks). However, please note that deleting the availability block does not automatically remove the `AvailabilityBlockId` that has previously been attached to reservation(s). It is currently not possible to disassociate a reservation from an availability block. You must cancel said reservation and create a new reservation, with the same conditions, and without the `AvailabilityBlockId`. 


### Testing your integration

Ensure you follow our general [guidelines](../guidelines.md) for testing integrations. In addition to this, and specific to Event Management integrations:

If you'd like to double-check that you are correctly creating all the reservations you want to retrieve, you can do so by [searching for the reservation, or related customer profile](https://intercom.help/mews-systems/en/articles/4258665-search-in-commander) or using the [Mews Reservation Report](https://help.mews.com/en/articles/4245884-reservation-report). 
To confirm you are relating any product that is not configured in Mews with the correct accounting category, you can review the Mews [Accounting Report](https://intercom.help/mews-systems/en/articles/4245918-accounting-report). If done correctly, the product you've posted will appear under the relevant accounting category.
